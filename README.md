<h1 align="center">Weather Dashboard</h1>

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. As a traveler, it's nice to see the weather outlook (especially when travelling multiple cities).  Having a great outlook, can create help a successful trip.  The user can plan a trip accordingly with this application.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.
## User Story

### As An End-User
    1. When I view current weather conditions for my desired city, I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index, I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
    2. WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
    3. WHEN I click on a city in the search history, I am again, presented with current and future conditions for that city.  WHEN I open the weather dashboard, I am presented with the last searched city forecast.

### As A Designer/Developer
    1. As a desiner and developer, the weather dashboard should have form inputs for the end user, in order to collect desired data.
    2. When the user search for a city the user should be presented with current, and future conditions for that city; and that city is should be added to the user's search history.

### Peer Code Review
Special thanks to my tutor, Phil, for helping me to understand how to correclty retrieve the data presented; and target the correct attributes.  A real change for myself was correctly applying the correct time structure to be displayed (40 objects would appeared, and I had to dive deeper of how and where I would 40/5=8).

## Repositiory End-Goal Criterea
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
Make it a point to tackle new code, weekly (at least, periodaclly); and break it down.  Try to understand the concepts, yourself.  This only makes you more credible, and a stonger developer: because you've taken the tim to study!  Remember this also, as a developer, your goal should be designing NEW experiences that makes people's lives simple; because as developers, we solve problems that people didn't even knew they had- even better, in a way that they do not understand: We are the super heroes and heriones of tomorrow; so get coding, and I hope this repository helps you along your development.  Stay on task, Get Ahead, Change The World! - [Frederick Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/discoverfrederickthomas/), Super Coding Ninja™
